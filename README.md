# Sudoku Solver
Play project created to learn the Elixir language.
The solver is rule based and acts as a normal player would by noting down possible values for the cells
and applying logic such as hidden-pairs to solve the board. The intention was to complete a small project
in the beginning of learning the language and perhaps come back later with more Elixir skills and refactor it.
